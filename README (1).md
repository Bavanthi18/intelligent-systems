# Image classification model (Vegtable/Fruit)

This Streamlit web application classifies images of fruits and vegetables using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. The app features a user-friendly interface with custom styling to enhance the user experience. Users can upload images of fruits or vegetables, and the app will predict the category along with the confidence level. Additionally, the app provides a visual representation of prediction confidence for each category and displays the model's accuracy over epochs.






## Features

Upload and Classify Images: Users can upload images in various formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP) to classify them as a specific fruit or vegetable.
Real-time Predictions: The app provides immediate predictions with a confidence score.
Save Uploaded Images: Option to save uploaded images locally.
Visualization: Displays prediction confidence as a bar chart and model accuracy over epochs.
Custom Styling: Enhanced UI with custom fonts, colors, and design elements for an improved user experience.


## How to use
